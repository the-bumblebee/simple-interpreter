# Part 1

### 1. calc1.py
This is a very simple and easy to understand interpreter that evaluates addition of two single digit numbers. No other operations are supported. 

eg: 1+1, 2+3 and so on.

Please do note that spaces arent allowed between the characters and if a space is encountered the program raises an exception.

## Execution

Run `python3 calc1.py` and enter the expression at the `calc> ` prompt.
